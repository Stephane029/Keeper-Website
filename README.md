Product Goal:
By April 2nd, we will create an event planner web application called Keeper.com which allows the user to plan events. Users can enter details into an event template to create their events. Event details such as number of participants, location, catering company, and date/time will be some of the items in the template. Keeper.com will save locally. Users will have the option to share events with a simple screen capture or text file.

Sprint Goal: 
The goal for this sprint was to modify the current note taking application to include a template with the following event details: Event name, Event description, Date and time, Venue, dietary options. The application will also save events and their details locally.
